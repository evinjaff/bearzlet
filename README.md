# Bearzlet

This is the final code for the CSE330 fianl project called Bearzlet. This app is intended to be a quizlet clone in which you can create a set of cards with a term and a definition to study with. With the set of cards, you are able to play flashcards or matching to study the flashcard set. I wrote most of the backend for the project, which was done in PHP 8 and used MongoDB for the databse. My partner, Lane, mostly worked on the frontend, which used Vue and Vanilla JS. I also worked on the electron implementation of our app, which meant that instead of navigating to the URL, our final project was an actual desktop application rather than a webpage like the other groups.

The EC2 that hosted the PHP and database is now down, but the PHP files that made the server work are still present. You could theoretically still run this application assuming you recode the static URLS.
